        <h2>Project Report</h2>
        <hr>
        <h4>Initial Planning:</h4>
        <p>After examining data available through the CDC and Census.gov, we decided to focus upon allocations of the
            Covid 19 vaccines by state. We wrote a project proposal, created an ERD for the database, set up a GitHub
            repository, and created a Bootstrap-based HTML framework for displaying the data. We planned to clean,
            join, and filter the data in a relational database in order to produce an effective representation of Covid
            19
            allocations by state. The tables we produced included a hard-coded vaccine information table, a state
            population table based on census data, and an allocation table based on CDC data (see the ERD, below).</p>
        <p>
            These tables were ultimately joined to produce analyses based on population per state vs. the number of
            vaccinated
            individuals.</p>
<hr>
        <h4>Extract:</h4>
        <p>We began by making API calls to <a
                href="https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/popest-popproj/popest.html"
                target="_blank">CDC</a>
            and <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/browse?q=COVID%20vaccine&sortBy=relevance" target="_blank">Census.gov</a>
            to extract the appropriate information. From the CDC, we
            pulled state-specific weekly allocation data for the Pfizer, Moderna, and Janssen vaccines. From the census,
            we pulled population estimates for each state for the last 10 years.
        </p>
        <hr>
        <h4>Transform:</h4>
        <p>We created several pandas dataframes to hold and analyze information. From our API calls to the CDC website,
            we created three dataframes, each devoted to storing CDC allocation data for one of the vaccines. We created
            a dataframe giving
            essential information about each vaccine, including required doses, days between doses, and minimum age. We
            also created a dataframe with state population data, which required filtering the dataframe to include only
            the most recent date (July 1, 2019). We extracted the substring that contained the date in order to isolate
            the most recent data. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            After creating these initial dataframes, we
            concatenated the
            three dataframes with CDC information on specific vaccine allocations into a single dataframe called 'allocation_df'. We reset the index, renamed columns for
            consistency, and dropped unnecessary columns. In addition, we joined our 'allocation_df' with the state and
            vaccine dfs and renamed the columns to match the plan in our ERD for our postgres db.</p>
        </p>
        <hr>
            <h4>Load:</h4>
        <p>We wrote an SQL script to set up the tables in postgres according to our ERD. We loaded the dataframe
            data into the postgres tables using SQLAlchemy. Then, we queried postgres from our jupyter notebook to
            retrieve the data from
            the tables. We chose to design a relational database in third normal form because it allows us to easily
            keep the vaccine and state
            information separate from the allocation table for easy updates and because all rows in each table have a
            consistent structure.</p>
